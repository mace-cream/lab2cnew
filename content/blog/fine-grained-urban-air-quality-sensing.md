### Introduction
The surveillance of air pollution is becoming a highly concerned issue for city residents and urban administrators. Apart from official air quality stations, we deployed a sensing system which consists of both mobile and static air quality sensors. We focus on research problems include:

- ensuring the system accuracy and stability, minimizing the impact from sensor drift and response delay;
- predicting pollution level at unobserved positions, using scene-specific machine learning methods;
- investigating the pollution sources and causes with information metric. At present, real-world experiments have been deployed in several cities in China, helping with local air quality monitoring and government.
