### System Overview
Gotcha is a taxi-based mobile sensing system for fine-grained environmental data acquisition and comprehensive city surveillance. It enables a taxi fleet as a compound mobile sensor platform that features a rich cluster of sensors, including the environmental sensors such as carbon-dioxide, carbon-monoxide, ozone, particulate matters, the climate sensors, such as temperature, humidity, barometer, and the physical sensors, such as audio, video, accelerometers, gyroscopes, GPS, and compasses.

The data acquired from the taxi fleet are transmitted to a data center through 3G cellular link when the vehicles are in motion, or via WiFi hotspots co-located with the electric car chargers, when the car stops to recharge the battery. Together with a back-end data cloud, Gotcha is capable of sensing and reconstructing the high-resolution maps of the urban environment for metropolitan areas.

The system is currently deployed on 10 electric taxi cabs in the city of Shenzhen, and will scale up to a fleet of 100 electric taxis by July 2015.
