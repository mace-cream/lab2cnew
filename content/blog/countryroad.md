### Introduction
The CountryRoad project was conducted in 2014 with the cooperation of Shunfengche Organization. The aim of the project was to help passengers who failed to buy train tickets to find another way to go home by matching them with the drivers who had similar routes and spare seats. Our main contribution was the matching algorithm that helped to handle the sequential arrived requests from both passengers and drivers, find the best suitable pair and return the result, if existed, as soon as possible to avoid the users became impatient. Besides the practical system, we also studied the impact of different matching strategies and notification strategies on the matching result.

We are now building the 2015 version of CountryRoad which would incorporate multiple-round confirmation mechanism as well as online payment system.
