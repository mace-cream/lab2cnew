### Introduction
With the deployment of ubiquitous sensors, human or vehicle trajectories obtained from call detail records or GPS devices provide abundant information of urban mobility. I have been focusing on understanding and extracting mobility patterns based on taxi GPS data, which could provide insights for traffic management authorities. These work are:

- Discovering how transportation network companies like Didi and Uber influence taxi industry;
- Utilizing taxi trip data for customized bus service area design;
- Partitioning city regions while extracting movement patterns to understand urban mobility.
